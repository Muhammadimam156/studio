## 2. Core Features

The application is organized into several key tools, each targeting a specific aspect of the startup ideation process.

### Startup Toolkit

This is the main suite of tools designed to build out your startup concept from the ground up.

- **Names & Taglines**: Generates creative and memorable names and taglines based on a simple description of your startup idea.
- **Elevator Pitch**: Crafts a concise and compelling elevator pitch to quickly explain your business to potential investors or customers.
- **Problem & Solution**: Helps you clearly define the problem your startup is solving and articulate how your solution addresses it.
- **Audience & UVP**: Defines your ideal target audience and your Unique Value Proposition (UVP) to differentiate you from the competition.
- **Website Hero Copy**: Generates engaging and persuasive copy for the hero section of your landing page to capture visitor attention.
- **Logo & Colors**: Provides creative concepts for a logo and a suggested color palette to guide your branding efforts.

### AI Text Generator

A flexible, general-purpose tool that can generate any kind of text content you can imagine. Simply provide a prompt, and the AI will generate a response, which can be edited, saved, and downloaded.

### My Library

All generated content can be saved to a personal library. This feature requires users to be signed in (currently supports anonymous sign-in) and stores all saved items in a secure, user-specific collection in Firestore. The library page allows you to view all your saved ideas in one place.

### Key UI/UX Features

- **Editable Results**: All AI-generated content is displayed in editable text areas, allowing for quick tweaks and refinements.
- **Regenerate Content**: Don't like the first result? A "Regenerate" button lets you get new suggestions based on the same prompt.
- **Download & Copy**: Easily copy content to your clipboard or download it as a `.txt` file.
- **Code Preview**: For certain generated content like the "Problem & Solution" statements, you can toggle between a visual preview and the raw HTML code.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is fully responsive and works seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Loading States**: While the AI is generating content, the UI provides a clear, blurred loading state to indicate that the application is busy.
